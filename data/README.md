Our image naming follows this format:

```sql
{TV show abbreviation}_{identity name}_{0 or 1}.jpg
```


For example: bbt_Alex_0.jpg

Explanation:

    {TV show abbreviation}: Refers to the abbreviation of the corresponding TV show. For example, bbt stands for The Big Bang Theory.
    {identity name}: Refers to the name of the identity. For example, Alex.
    {0 or 1}: Indicates the source of the image:
        0 means the image is obtained from Google search.
        1 means the image is automatically extracted from the video frame.

Notes:

    There is a small probability of misalignment between the identity and the image, regardless of whether the image is sourced from Google search or video frame extraction.
